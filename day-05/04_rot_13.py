## **EXERCISE: The ROT-13 Algorithm**

**OBJECTIVE:** Given some message (string) to encode, we want to design a function that changes every letter in the string to the letter that is `13` positions forward in the English alphabet.

**INPUT:** `"hello there"`

**OUTPUT:** `"uryyb gurer"`

## **BONUS: The ROT-N Algorithm**

**OBJECTIVE:** Given some message (a string) to encode, construct a class with the ability to apply a ROT substitution transformation to encrypt (or decrypt) the message with degree `N`.

**INPUT:** `"hello there"`, `13`

**OUTPUT:** `"uryyb gurer"`
